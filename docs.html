name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>This module solves the problem with reading large and huge text files in Perl. It is designed to read only block by block as needed. It does not load the whole file into memory, it only reads one block at a time and once the last sequential line reached, it reads the next block from the file and frees the previous block from memory, so at all times only one block of the file is kept in menory.</p>

<p>For example if you are reading a 2GB file, once you start reading lines from the file, the module reads the first block from the file on disk, while you loop through the lines, when you reach the line at the end of the read block, the module delete this block from memory and read the next block from the file on disk and parses it to lines and so on.</p>
